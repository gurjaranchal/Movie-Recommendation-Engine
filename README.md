## Movie Recommendation System

### Submission for Microsoft Engage Mentorship Program 2022
### Algorithms 
```
Demonstrate through your app the different kinds of algorithms that a 
web-streaming app (like Netflix) or an audio-streaming app (like 
Spotify) may use for their Recommendation Engine.

KNN Algorithm used for making Recommendation Engine
K-Nearest Neighbor is a algorithm that stores all the available cases and 
classifies the new data based on similarity measure.
KNN calculates the distance from all points in the proximity of the unknown 
data and filters out the ones with the shortest distances to it. As a result, 
it’s often referred to as a distance-based algorithm.
 
 ```
### Technology Used 
```
Python(3.10.4)
Streamlit version(1.9.0)
Use of IMDB movie links from dataset (to fetch the information of movies)
Use DataSet (downloaded from kaggle)
```
### Features 

- Simple responsive UI
- Movie Story
- Movie Posters
- Directors & Cast information
- IMDB Ratings⭐
- Implemantion of KNN Algorithm from scratch
- Compare the Built model using Scikit Learn

### Instructions
```
1. Clone my repository
2. Open CMD in working directory.
3. Run following command.
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      streamlit run app.py

To run app, write following commands above in CMD. or use any IDE.
app.py is the main Python file of Streamlit Web-Application.
Classifier.py is the main file which is containing a KNN Algorithm.
MovieRecommendationModel.ipynb is the notebook of data processing.

```
### Deployment
```
Movie Recommendation Engine deployed on Heroku
```
